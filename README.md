# interpolation-challenges
A repository for hosting some interpolation challenges for research


## Data
Here is the description of the challenge. 

We have a 2D array, 12501x69, 12501 time samples at a sampling rate of 0.002 s from 69 stations.

The data is micro69.npy, and the coordinate file is micro69xy.npy. 

An example of visualizing the data is in the script. 


## Challange
The challenge is to interpolate this sparsely sampled 2D array into a 3D array while preserving the waveform details at the recording stations.
